# Pewlett_Hackark_Analysis

## Overview of Project
This project is to investigate the relationship among the number of rides, trip durations, genders, usertype, day of the week, and the time of the day. The detail analysis is implemented in the file NYC_Bike_Sharing.twb. 

This project focuses on following items:
 - **User types** catetorizes number of users by regular customers and subscribers. 
 - **Trip duration by ages** shows the relationship between trip durations and ages.
 - **Checkout times** summarizes the number of rides by trip durations. 
 - **Checkout times by genders** presents the number of rides by trip durations and genders. 
 - **Trips by weekday and time** depicts the number of rides by the time of the day and the day of the week. 
 - **Trips by weekday, time, and genders** expresses the number of rides by time, weekday, and genders. 
 - **Trips by weekday, time, genders, and user types** presents the number of rides by time, weekday, genders, and user types.

### Trip durations by ages
The trip durations of users who were born before 1925 fluctuate significantly. The lengthiest belongs to the those between 1890 and 1893 with up to 45 hours riding. For those who were born from 1925, the younger they are, the longer they ride. One exception is the group of people with birth year of around 1970. Their trip durations are long (up to 36 hours).
